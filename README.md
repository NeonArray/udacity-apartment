# Udacity Apartment

This project took me around 4 hours to complete. I enjoyed getting some practice with lighting and animation. Placing the models and setting
up the scene was not as satisfying. 

The most challenging aspect was the lighting. Both in terms of tweaking the 
lights themselves to look pleasing, but also the directions in the rubric were a little confusing.
